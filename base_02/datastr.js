//array
const myarr=[1,3,5];
//we also get prototype acess in array

// Array methods
myarr.push(6);

// myarr.pop();
myarr.unshift(9);//add in the first
myarr.unshift(10);
myarr.shift();//just like pop but delets from front
console.log (myarr);


//.join converts the array into strings
//.slice->myarr.slice(1,3)->doesn't include the last in range and doesn't make changes in original array.
//.splice->myarr.splice(1,3)->does include the last range and make changes in the original array
